Ray is a desktop debugging app that keeps the instant feedback you get from console.log() and dump() but lets you use the same debugging syntax across Laravel, PHP, JavaScript and more frameworks and languages.

- Send anything you want to Ray, including HTML, arrays, queries, and Markdown files.
- View and interact with output your AI sends to Ray using our MCP server. 
- Measure performance and pause execution in PHP.
- Beautifully designed themes to match your style.
